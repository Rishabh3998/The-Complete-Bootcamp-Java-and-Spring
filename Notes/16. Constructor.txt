Constructors
============

1) Definition
- A constructor is a special method used to initialize new objects.
- Name must match the class name.
- No return type (not even void).
- Automatically invoked during object creation via `new ClassName(...)`.

2) Types
- Default constructor: compiler-provided no-arg constructor when no constructors are declared.
- No-arg constructor: user-defined constructor with no parameters.
- Parameterized constructor: accepts arguments to initialize fields.
- Copy constructor: not built-in, but implemented manually to copy fields from another instance.

3) Rules & behavior
- Can be overloaded (multiple constructors with different parameter lists).
- If any constructor is defined, compiler does NOT create a default constructor.
- Access modifiers (public, protected, private) control visibility and instantiation.
- Constructors are not inherited.
- Abstract classes can declare constructors (used by subclasses).
- final fields must be initialized by the constructor (or at declaration).

4) Chaining & inheritance
- Use `this(...)` to call another constructor in the same class (must be first statement).
- Use `super(...)` to call a parent class constructor (must be first statement).
- If no `super(...)` call appears, Java inserts a call to the no-arg constructor of the superclass.

5) Object creation sequence (simplified)
- Allocate memory and set default values.
- Execute superclass constructors (top-down).
- Execute instance variable initializers & instance initializers.
- Execute the chosen constructor body.

6) Common pitfalls
- Forgetting to define a no-arg constructor when a framework or serialization needs it.
- Accidentally declaring a constructor with a return type (becomes a method).
- Not handling deep copy when copying mutable fields.

7) Examples
class Point {
    private final int x, y;

    // parameterized constructor
    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    // copy constructor
    public Point(Point other) {
        this(other.x, other.y);
    }
}

class ColorPoint extends Point {
    private final String color;

    public ColorPoint(int x, int y, String color) {
        super(x, y);          // call superclass constructor
        this.color = color;
    }
}

8) When to use
- Use constructors for mandatory initialization and to keep objects in a valid state.
- For complex initialization or multiple construction strategies, consider static factory methods.

Note: Everytime we create an object, constructor will be called.
