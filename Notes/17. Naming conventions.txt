### Naming Convention in Java

We generally follow some particular naming conventions while writing code in Java, these are:

I. camelCase [showMyMarks(), viewPage(), etc.]

1. For class and Interface:
   - We start with Capital letters: Calculator, Human, MyData, etc.

2. For Variables and Methods (But if single word is there) : 
   - We start with small letters: start(), showData(), etc.

3. For Constants:
   - Whole word should be in Capital letters: PIE, EPSILON, etc.

4. For Multiple Words:
   - Like showMyMarks(), viewPage(), etc.

II. snake_case [show_my_marks, view_page, etc.]
