### Anonymous object

[Some Context]: So whenever we create any object Eg: Human human = new Human();
Then, we don't actually create any object, we are creating a reference variable, which is getting stored inside the
Stack and the address of the object is the value of this reference variable, the real object is getting created inside 
the heap memory, and the reference variable is pointing to that object via address.

Now, the question is do we really need this line:
Human human = new Human();

First of all let's learn about reference creation:

A obj; // reference creation
obj = new A();

new A(); // This is the object creation, the whole line is not object creation

So, the above line where object is getting created but we are not storing it in any reference variable, considered as
the Anonymous Object.

Object with no name is Anonymous Object. The catch is we cannot re-use this kind of object. It can be use only once.
