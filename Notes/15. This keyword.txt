'this' keyword
==============

1) What is 'this'?
- 'this' is a reference to the current object (the instance on which a non-static method or constructor is invoked).
- Useful to refer to instance variables, methods, and to pass the current object to other methods/constructors.

2) Common uses / patterns
- Disambiguating fields from parameters:
    public class Person {
            private String name;
            public Person(String name) {
                    this.name = name;           // 'this.name' = field; 'name' = parameter
            }
    }

- Calling another constructor in same class (constructor chaining):
    public class Rectangle {
            private int w, h;
            public Rectangle() { this(1, 1); } // must be the first statement
            public Rectangle(int w, int h) {
                    this.w = w;
                    this.h = h;
            }
    }

- Returning 'this' for method chaining (fluent APIs):
    public class Builder {
            public Builder setA(int a) { this.a = a; return this; }
    }

- Passing current object as argument:
    someService.register(this);

3) Rules & restrictions
- 'this' cannot be used in static context (static methods or static initializers).
- In constructors, a call to another constructor using this(...) must be the first statement if used.
- You cannot use 'this' before super() has run during object construction, because the object is not fully initialized.
- 'this' refers to the current instance; in an instance method it is always available.

4) Inner classes and qualification
- For non-static inner classes, 'this' refers to the inner instance. To reference the outer instance, use OuterClass.this:
    class Outer {
            int x;
            class Inner {
                    int x;
                    void m() {
                            int innerX = this.x;         // inner's x
                            int outerX = Outer.this.x;   // outer's x
                    }
            }
    }

- Anonymous inner classes: 'this' refers to the anonymous object itself.
- Lambda expressions: 'this' refers to the enclosing instance (not the lambda object).

5) Common pitfalls and notes
- Don't try to use 'this' in static methods: compilation error.
- Using 'this' inside a constructor to call an instance method that can be overridden may cause issues, because subclasses' 
overridden methods may run before subclass initialization is complete.
- Prefer this.field notation when constructor parameter names shadow field names — it's idiomatic and clear.

6) Small examples
- Disambiguation:
    public class Example {
            private int value;
            public void setValue(int value) {
                    this.value = value;
            }
    }

- Constructor chaining:
    public class Point {
            int x, y;
            public Point() { this(0, 0); }
            public Point(int x, int y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; }
    }

- Passing 'this':
    public class Node {
            void register(NodeHandler h) { h.accept(this); }
    }

7) Summary
- 'this' is the instance reference: use it to disambiguate fields, chain constructors, implement fluent APIs, pass the 
object around, and refer to outer instances from inner classes.
- Always remember static contexts cannot use 'this', and constructor chaining rules require this(...) to be first statement.
