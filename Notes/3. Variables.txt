Variables are container which we use to store data. We can use these data in future to perform any kind of operation.

Data-types:

1. Primitive Data-types
   - Integer -> byte, short, int, long
   - Float -> double (by-default), float
   - Character
   - Boolean

   - Size and Range of data-types:
     
     - Integer
     - byte => 1 byte (-2^7 to 2^7 => -128 to 127)
     - short => 2 bytes (-2^15 to 2^15 - 1)
     - int => 4 bytes (-2^31 to 2^31 - 1)
     - long => 8 bytes (-2^63 to 2^63 - 1)

     - float
     - float => 4 bytes
     - double => 8 bytes

     - Character
     - char => 2 bytes (uses UNICODE for numbers)

     - Boolean
     - boolean => takes true or false only 


2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data-types
