### Class and Object basics

1) What is a class?
- A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (state) and behaviors (methods) for objects.
- Syntax: "class ClassName { /* fields, constructors, methods */ }"

2) What is an object?
- An object is a concrete instance of a class created at runtime.
- Each object has its own state stored in instance variables.

3) Important class components
- Fields (instance variables): store object state (e.g., name, age).
- Methods: functions that operate on fields / perform actions.
- Constructors: special methods used to create objects (same name as the class).
    - Default constructor: no-arg; provided automatically if none defined.
    - Parameterized constructors: initialize fields at creation.
- Access modifiers:
    - public: accessible anywhere.
    - private: accessible only within the class (use getters/setters to access).
    - protected / package-private: control narrower visibility.
- static members: belong to the class itself, not to instances.

4) Key concepts
- Encapsulation: hide internal state; expose behavior via methods/getters/setters.
- Abstraction: focus on essential behavior, hide implementation details.
- Inheritance: classes extend other classes to reuse/extend behavior.
- Polymorphism: treat subclass objects as instances of superclass (method overriding).
- Immutability: objects whose state cannot change after creation (final fields, no setters).

5) Memory notes (simple)
- Objects live on the heap.
- References to objects can live on the stack (local variables).
- static members live in the class area (shared across instances).

6) Example: simple class and usage

public class Person {
        // fields (state)
        private String name;
        private int age;

        // default constructor
        public Person() {
                this.name = "Unknown";
                this.age = 0;
        }

        // parameterized constructor
        public Person(String name, int age) {
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
        }

        // getters / setters (encapsulation)
        public String getName() { return name; }
        public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }

        public int getAge() { return age; }
        public void setAge(int age) { this.age = age; }

        // behavior
        public void sayHello() {
                System.out.println("Hi, my name is " + name + " and I'm " + age + " years old.");
        }

        // override toString for easy printing
        @Override
        public String toString() {
                return "Person{name='" + name + "', age=" + age + "}";
        }
}

public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
                // create objects (instances)
                Person p1 = new Person();                  // default constructor
                Person p2 = new Person("Alice", 30);       // parameterized constructor

                p1.setName("Bob");
                p1.setAge(25);

                p1.sayHello();   // prints: Hi, my name is Bob and I'm 25 years old.
                System.out.println(p2); // prints Person{name='Alice', age=30}
        }
}

7) Practical tips for beginners
- Prefer private fields + getters/setters for encapsulation.
- Use constructors to ensure objects start in a valid state.
- Keep classes focused (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Start with simple POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) to model data.
- Experiment in a small main() or unit tests to create/use objects and observe behavior.

8) Short checklist when creating a class
- What state is needed? -> fields
- What actions are needed? -> methods
- How will the object be created? -> constructors
- What should be visible outside? -> choose access modifiers
- Should any logic be shared across instances? -> static

That's a compact guide to classes and objects in Java — enough to get started and to write simple class-based code.
